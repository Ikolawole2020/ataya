    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to provide comprehensive support and care for children suffering from 
        <strong>Autism and Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome</strong>. We aim to raise awareness, offer resources, 
        and create a community where families can find hope and healing.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe that every child deserves access to the best medical care and emotional support 
        to navigate their journey. Through education, advocacy, and fundraising, we strive to make 
        a positive impact in the lives of these children and their families.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our dedicated team works tirelessly to ensure that families have the resources they need, 
        from financial assistance to educational materials about managing chronic pain.
